# Seismic-Fault-Mapping

## Overview
This is an ongoing project on building a deep learning learning models to accurately detect fault from seismic images using tensorflow

## Dataset Overview
The synthetic data were taken from FORCE competition provided by XEEK.ai. To get more information, follow the link at XEEK.ai

An example of a seismic images with fault overlay:

## Model
The current model uses a simple U-Net framework using Tensorflow implementation:
